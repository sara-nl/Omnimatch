This distro has only been tested on Lisa, the Dutch National Compute
Cluster. It is based on the `qmake` Makefile generator, part of the Qt GUI
library from Trolltech.

== Building ==
1.	`cd` into the root of the distro tree.
2.	Source the file 'setenv.sh' into your current shell. In
	bash, you'd do this by running `source loadmodules.shell`
3.	Run `qmake -o Makefile`; this should create a file called
	./Makefile.
4.	Run `make`. This should produce a binary 'bin/omnimatch.bin'.

== Running ==
1.	If you haven't already done so, source file 'loadmodules.shell' into
	your current shell.
2. Instead of running the binary itself directly, you should run a wrapper
	script called 'bin/omnimatch'.
